This repo contains examples on how to use AuditJS in:

- CircleCI
- TravisCI
- GitHub Actions

Jenkins example TBD

## Usage in CircleCI

Please refer to the [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/example-auditjs-repo/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) for a working config on using `auditjs` in CircleCI.

NOTES:

- We run auditjs using `npx` as this prevents a global install. If you want it to be longer lived, you can install globally.
- We use `--xml` to output a JUnit type XML test result format, and then save that so that you can view vulnerable dependencies as test failures. This is entirely a suggestion, you do not need to do that if you don't want to.

## Usage in TravisCI

Please refer to the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/example-auditjs-repo/blob/master/.travis.yml) for a working config on using `auditjs` in TravisCI.

NOTES:

- We run auditjs using `npx` as this prevents a global install. If you want it to be longer lived, you can install globally.

## Usage with GitHub Actions

Please refer to the [.github/workflows/nodejs.yml](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/example-auditjs-repo/blob/master/.github/workflows/nodejs.yml) for a working config on using `auditjs` in TravisCI. You can see the output generated by looking at the action [on this repo](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/example-auditjs-repo/actions).

NOTES:

- We run auditjs using `npx` as this prevents a global install. If you want it to be longer lived, you can install globally.
